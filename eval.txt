What Phoenician story could be the basis for the Titanes story?
m1: As far as I know, the answer to both questions is that it probably never happened. There were no real person who was known by name (although there may
have been other versions) and the story was not told in order to scare kids before bedtime.
There are some stories which do contain elements of truth. We can assume that something like this actually happened once, but we cannot know for sure.
Titanes is one such story. A long time ago, a king had two sons. One of them was good at playing the harp and very talented with his words as well. He
was so successful in all he did that people thought he might be the next king to succeed the throne.
One day, however, while on a journey somewhere outside Phoenicia, this prince suddenly went blind in one eye. People thought it would be dangerous for
him to continue on his way alone. They offered their assistance by bringing him a physician who could heal him of blindness.
But he refused. He knew that the only reason why he had been blinded was because he had angered an enemy king and so wanted to stay hidden from the
world, in order not to become involved in any more quarrels with people who had done him wrong. His mother begged him not to be such a hermit. The
prince replied: “My eyes are not my own; it is God’s sight that I have lost.”
His father knew what his son was up against and tried to reason with him, but the boy refused all help from anyone.
The king did not give up. Instead he decided to use a different method of finding his son. He would send messengers out everywhere in Phoenicia
calling for this prince. In the meantime, however, he ordered that an army be assembled and sent it off in search of him. The king hoped that by
bringing together all possible people against the one person whom everyone had already given up on, they might succeed.
The army was sent out. And after a while it happened that one day this prince was found. He looked very different than he used to look. His eyes were
closed and his face seemed much older. People who knew him would say: “Where is the young man we all loved so much?”
In this way, everyone believed that the same thing had happened which they themselves feared from a long time ago — blindness in one eye.
It was not the prince’s fault that he had been blinded but rather it was God’s wish that this should happen. The king did not give up trying to find
him and finally succeeded, for he found his son who had become blind as if by magic, with only one eye remaining. Everyone rejoiced at this wonderful
miracle.
After this, the prince had a great sense of responsibility towards people who had done him wrong in the past. He went everywhere from Phoenicia all
over the world preaching and telling everyone about God’s love.
He wanted to bring salvation into the hearts of those who believed that they were better than others or could do more than others. After this, he died
peacefully and was buried by his father. But before he breathed his last breath, he said to everyone: “Do not be afraid of what you have done with me;
I will never forget how God has loved you all.”

I'm starting a new Roleplaying campaign soon, and my character is norse/icelandic themed. One of the other character is inspired by Kitsune. I want to find out what, if anything, might my character mistake this character for? I've done some limited research, and it seems like either Fylgja or Hamingja ..? But I'm not clear if that's just because I've misread the wikipedia pages.

There are a many Greek myths that are set in a wedding, like Thetis wedding as the origin of the Trojan War (see also Harmonia's necklace and Orion's earthborn myth). Are there other tales in major mythologies that are set in a wedding? I am looking for myths that are set in a wedding and not origin myths of wedding rituals per se.

Someone drew this symbol on my arm, and said it was an egyptian one and had some meaning, but I can't find it anywhere. The top that is obscured curls to the left.

I am searching for background information on the ancient Egyptian goddess Nakith. Wikipedia says she's a goddess of the underworld. Apart from that I was unable to find more on the web, and Wikipedia references a book which is out of print. Does anybody know if she was a local goddess and therefore only worshipped in a certain region? If so, where? Additionally, any hints about her exact function in the underworld would be great.

Xianxia stories often contain the following elements: 1> Cultivation of Qi: Qi is a humor-esque substance which is generally absorbed from the environment and stored in the Dan Tian which in these stories is a virtual space near the navel. One starts with no Qi, then accumulates enough to fill the Dan Tian with gaseous Qi which is progressively liquidified and then solidified as one improves in level. Past the point of solidification and a few further compressions the thing usually develops into an independent universe inside the owner where stars, planets, life etc. may be spontaneously created / born or inserted from outside. 2> Elemental Travel: Travel through the soil, through water, as wind etc. 3> Pill refining: Various plant and animal parts are put in a cauldron, special hand gestures are made, Qi is infused into the cauldron and at the end, if successful, everything automatically congeals into a spherical pill without the need for molds etc. Pills have levels according to their "Qi" and "Medicinal Purity" and if these are sufficiently high, can even be "alive" or "sentient". Everything is handwaved away inside the story world as "Daoism" but did historical Daoist/Buddhist scriptures or even folklore contain such elements, especially the stomach-universe and the sentient pills? Edit: I am trying to trace the evolution of these ideas as presented in Xianxia. Names of and / or links to the earliest known works that contain any of these elements in the sense described above are also part of the "references" I'm looking for.

There are a lot of instances in viking history where one of them wold carve this graffiti on a wall, one of the most famous being the Halfdan inscription on the Hagia Sophia. I've been looking everywhere for a restored version of this text with no luck. Does someone know how is this text written in Elder Futhark runes?

Charon is known as the ferryman of the River Styx, letting certain people cross the river with a fee. Charon himself is well known for helping many significant heroes in multiple Greek legends. He always seems to collect a toll from those who cross the River Styx with his assisstance. What exactly does Charon do with the toll money he receives from his passengers? And why exactly does he need to collect a toll?

Can anyone help me? I am looking for a mythological flying creature(s) that has saved human life? I am asking for a project in progress. Thanks.

The Trojan princess Cassandra was cursed by Apollo that nobody would ever believe her. Apparently though, the curse wasn't completely effective:
After Cassandra grew up, she again spent a night in the temple. This time the god appeared and tried to get her to yield to his desire, but she refused. For this affront to him he punished her by causing her prophecies, though true, to be disbelieved. This curse failed to be effective on only one occasion. When Paris appeared as an adult at the court of Priam, Cassandra declared him her brother. It had been accepted by everyone that he had died in infancy from being exposed. Source: Women of Classical Mythology: A Biographical Dictionary, Robert E. Bell
One version of Paris' return is told by Hyginus, in his Fabulae:
[91] XCI. ALEXANDER PARIS After Priam, son of Laomedon, had had many children by Hecuba, daughter of Cisseus or of Dymas, his wife, again pregnant, in a dream saw herself giving birth to a glowing firebrand from which many serpents issued. When this vision was reported to all the seers, they bade her slay whatever child she should bear to avoid its being the ruin of the country. After Hecuba gave birth to Alexander, he was handed over to be killed, but the servants out of pity exposed him. Shepherds found the child, raised him as their own, and named him Paris. When he came to young manhood, he had a favorite bull. Servants sent by Priam to bring a bull to be given as prize in funeral games in Paris’ honor, came and started to lead off the bull of Paris. He followed them and asked them where they were leading him. They stated that they were taking him to Priam . . . [to be prize] for the victor in the funeral games of Alexander. He, out of fondness for the bull, went down and won everything, even over his own brothers. In anger Deiphobus drew his sword against him, but he leaped to the altar of Zeus Herceus. When Cassandra prophetically declared he was her brother, Priam acknowledged him and received him into the palace. Source: The Myths of Hyginus, translated and edited by Mary Grant.
What was so special about that particular instance? Why did the Trojans believe Cassandra's recognition of Paris?
